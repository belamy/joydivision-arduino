This is the fork of digital joystick adapter JoyDivision - http://www.onyxsoft.se/joydivision.html

Main reason to create this fork is to use very popular arduino board to connect "retro" digital joystick to computer. This adapter is very useful to play "retro" computers/consoles on emulators.

Project was tested on:
- Arduino Pro Mini with ATmega 168

Future test on:
- Arduino Pro Mini with ATmega 328p
- Arduino Nano
